A simple toolbox to get an intuition how different model types are influenced by a new data point.
This toolbox was published at the ICML 2022 Workshop [DataPerf: Benchmarking Data for Data-Centric AI](https://sites.google.com/view/dataperf2022).

## Apps 
Currently, there are two different apps available: 
- [Slide a point and observe model changes](https://danilobr94-dv-toolbox-app-home-jikl1j.streamlitapp.com/)
- [Create a heatmap](https://danilobr94-dv-toolbox-app-heatmap-719jxk.streamlitapp.com/)
